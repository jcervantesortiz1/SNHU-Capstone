    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This code review focuses on three key projects from my portfolio:
        <strong>Inventory Tracking Application, Grazioso Salvare Dashboard, Animal Database and Dashboard</strong>.
        These artifacts align with three critical categories of computer science:
        <strong>Software Engineering and Design</strong>, <strong>Algorithms and Data Structures</strong>, 
        and <strong>Databases</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through this review, I analyze the current functionality of these projects, identify key areas for improvement, 
        and outline planned enhancements. This is an informal code review so the review focusses on the directly actionable
        items I was looking to address, while skipping over the various stylistic and syntaxtical errors, since those 
        are issues that would be addressed regardless of the project.
        The various updates and enhancements made to the systems highlight my proficiency in identifying areas of concern
        within large projects, while still designing robust, scalable, secure, and user focussed software solutions.

  <h2>Code Review Highlights</h2>
  
  <h3>Enhancement 1: Software Engineering and Design</h3>
  <h4>Inventory Management Application Overview</h4>
  <p>
    This project is an inventory management application that allows the user to sign in and manage their inventory. The 
    application currently consists of two separate SQLite databases that hold login information and user inventory. The 
    user can view, add, update, and delete items from their inventory. All information is saved locally on to the device 
    and runs on android 14 and newer. The application also has a notification system that will send the user a text message 
    if an items inventory is low or gets deleted.
  </p>
  <h4>Identified Weaknesses</h4>
  <ol>
    <li><p><strong>Login and Sign Up Process</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users can sign up and log in, but any time the app is closed and re-opened it has them log in again. They dont stay signed in.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Log Out</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is no way for the user to log out, they have to close the app and re-open it to be logged out.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Notification(s)</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The system sends the user a text message (if they allow the permission) any time they update an item or delete an item.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Input Validation</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is no input validation, which causes the app to crash if the users leaves a field blank when adding or updating an item.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Planned Enhancements</h4>
  <ol>
    <li><p><strong>Login and Sign Up Process</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Add the Android Session Manager to save a user profile once they have successfully logged in. This will make it so that once the user re-opens the app they will be taken to the main page.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Log Out</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>On the main page there should be a log out button. When the log out button is pressed it will clear the user profile saved to the session manager. They will then be taken back to the log in page. If the user re-opens the app it should bring them to the log in page.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Notification(s)</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>System should send the user a POST notification when an item's amount is less than or equal to 1.</li>
        <li>An SMS message should be sent to the phone number on the device if an item is deleted.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  
  <h3>Enhancement 2: Algortihms and Data Structures</h3>
  <h4>Grazioso Salvare Pet Management System</h4>
  <p>
    This project is an animal management system that allows the user to track various things about the dogs and monkeys they have. 
    Users also have the ability to reserve animals directly from the system.
  </p>
  <h4>Identified Weaknesses</h4>
  <ol>
    <li><p><strong>Class Structure</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>All of the system logic is in the Driver.java class as well as the main method.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Insecure Coding</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is nothing to prevent invalid data to be passed in. Things like empty lines, and invalid characters will cause the system to crash.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>ArrayList Data Storage</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>There are two ArrayLists to hold the dog and monkey objects. The system must itterate through the entire ArrayList when searching for an animal.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Planned Enhancements</h4>
  <ol>
    <li><p><strong>Updated Class Structure</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Move all of the system logic to a new Logic.java class, leaving only the main method and the menu method in the Driver.java class.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Secure Coding</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Add secure coding practices to ensure that the system doesn't crash when an invalid character is input.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Updated to a HashMap Storage System</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Update the system to use a HashMap that uses the Name as the key. This means that each animal must be uniquely named.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  
  <h3>Enhancement 3: Databases</h3>
  <h4>Animal Database and Dashboard</h4>
  <p>
    The project first involves creating a python script to create, read, update, and delete information from the MongoDB. Then a 
    dashboard is created to read data from the database. The system is created on the Ubuntu device, and consists of a MongoDB 
    database, a python driver class, and a DASH dashboard. It also includes a README file for the stakeholders so they may reproduce 
    the system or install it.
  </p>
  <h4>Identified Weaknesses</h4>
  <p>The overall enhancements proposed for this project are directly tied to the systems migration to Windows, so the system must be
    re-created for windows. The system also has no testing class to ensure that it works as expected and connects properly for the create, 
    update, and delete functions.</p>
  <h4>Planned Enhancements</h4>
  <ol>
    <li><p><strong>Re-create the MongoDB Database</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create the animal database by using MongoDB Compass, which allows for easier management of the database.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Testing and Error Handling</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A testing class needs to be created to ensure proper functionality of the system, as well as added error handling to the driver class to ensure the system would notify users of any issues.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Dashboard Visual Improvements</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Update the dashboards layout to have a better design, while also adding filter options to the data table.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Update README</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The system's README file has to be updated to reflect the changes needed to run the system on Windows.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
