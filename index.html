    <h2>Category 1: Software Engineering and Design</h2>
    <h3>Quick Overview</h3>
    <p>The artifact that was improved was the CS-360 Inventory App. For the enhancement of this project the login and signup methods were updated to allow users to stay signed in if they choose to. The notification system was also updated to only send a notification if the updated quantity is updated to 1 or less.

    <h2>Category 2: Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
    <h3>Quick Overview</h3>
<p>This enhancement was done to improve the IT-145 Animal Management application. The enhancement was to add input validation to the application. Furthermore the class structure was updated to have a logic class which handles things like adding and removing animals from the program. The search algorithm was also updated to be able to better handle a large amount of items.</p>

    <h2>Category 3: Databases</h2>
    <h3>Quick Overview</h3>
<p>The CS-340 Database project was used as the artifact for this section. The enhancement consists of properly porting the project from a linux environment to a Windows environment. This enhancement consists of recreating  the MongoDB on a local machine, An updated CRUD Python driver will be created, as well as a new User Interface. The project also consists of a README file so that users or stakeholders are able to install or recreate the projecct on the Windows system.</p>
