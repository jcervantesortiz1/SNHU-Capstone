    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>This porfolio integrates the knowledge and skills I have acquired and developed throughout my time studying Computer Science and Software engineering at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). It is designed and developed with a professional quality written and visual communications that demonstate my abilities through the identification and implementation of my enhancements. </p>

<section class="enhancement">
    <h2>Professional Self-Assesment</h2>
    <p>These projects show my growth in various areas. There were many things I have learned while taking courses at SNHU. </p>

    <h3>Communicating and Collaboration</h3>
    <p>Through the creation of this portfolio and different class projects while at SNHU, I have acquired skills that pertain to collaborating with others. I have learned how to work using Agile methodologies, code reviews, and GitHub tools to create a collaborative environment with other developers, or stakeholders. Expanding on that point I also improved my written communication to create proper system documentation for users, stakeholders, and fellow developers. Lastly developing the various projects I learned how to effectively identify and meet user and system requirements while managing trade-offs and limitations.</p>

  <h3>Security</h3>
  <p>Security is at the forefront of all software development. Whether it be a simple command prompt program, or an integrate website or mobile application security plays a big role in ensuring they work as required. </p>

    <h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
    <h3>Throughout this Portfolio, and within my artifacts and each narritive I demonstarate my skills and knowledge in the following outcomes</h3>
    <p>1.	Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science. </p>
    <p>2.	Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.</p>
    <p>3.	Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.</p>
    <p>4.	Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.</p>
    <p>5.	Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.</p>

  <h3 id="which-course-outcomes-does-each-enhancement-meet-">Which Course Outcomes Does Each Enhancement Meet?</h3>
  <h4 id="enhancement-one-inventory-management-application">Enhancement One: Inventory Management Application</h4>
  <p>The course outcomes that pertain to Enhancement One are outcomes 2, 3, 4, and 5. The project focuses on anticipating potential users' needs by providing useful features they might want. The updated application also now uses a separate validation class that checks the users’ input and ensures that it is safe before passing it into the system. Furthermore, the system uses the input validation to ensure that data is properly configured before the query is sent to the database. If it is not, then the system will not allow the user to continue until it is corrected. An example of this is when the user leaves a field empty in the login or sign-up page, but also if the user leaves any of the item fields empty when adding or updating it. Finally the project was created using Android Studio and Java which provides many features that focus on scalability and even the option to launch the application on the Google Play Store.</p>
  
  <h3 id="enhancement-two-grazioso-salvare-pet-management-system">Enhancement Two: Grazioso Salvare Pet Management System</h3>
  <p>Course outcomes 3, 4, and 5. The system uses different algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution to create a system that adequately meets all of the clients’ needs while managing the tradeoffs that are involved in design choices. The project also demonstrates my ability to use the unique features of Java to deliver value to the system. These two outcomes are show through the re-design of the class structure to better reflect proper inheritance and scalability. The migration from an array list to a hash map is also important for adding value to the system. When a system only has a few items there will be little to no difference between using an array list and using a HashMap, but when looking at potentially having hundreds of items, the HashMap will offer faster retrieval. Lastly it helps develop a security mindset because the system anticipates potentially invalid inputs through the addition of try-catch blocks.</p>
  
  <h3 id="enhancement-three-animal-database-and-dashboard">Enhancement Three: Animal Database and Dashboard</h3>
  <p>Course outcomes that pertain to this enhancement are 1, 2, 3, and 4. It aligns with the first outcome because the dashboard is one that would be used by various users at a time. This means that the system needs to be able to manage a large number of users at any time. The second outcome is to create professional communications for specific audiences. The project consists of a README file that was created to allow users and stakeholders to install the system on their Windows system. Outcomes three and four pertain to this project because it uses different systems to function so ensuring that they all work together is important. Managing the different limitations of each system is important when working with different systems.</p>

    <h2>Category 1: Software Engineering and Design</h2>
    <h3>Quick Overview</h3>
    <p>The artifact that was improved was the CS-360 Inventory App. For the enhancement of this project the login and signup methods were updated to allow users to stay signed in if they choose to. The notification system was also updated to only send a notification if the updated quantity is updated to 1 or less. Lastly overall system improvements were cdone and un necessary methods ewre removed or properly connected.</p>

    <h2>Category 2: Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
    <h3>Quick Overview</h3>
<p>This enhancement was done to improve the IT-145 Animal Management application. The enhancement was to add input validation to the application. Furthermore the class structure was updated to have a logic class which handles things like adding and removing animals from the program. The search algorithm was also updated to be able to better handle a large amount of items.</p>

    <h2>Category 3: Databases</h2>
    <h3>Quick Overview</h3>
<p>The CS-340 Database project was used as the artifact for this section. The enhancement consists of properly porting the project from a linux environment to a Windows environment. This enhancement consists of recreating  the MongoDB on a local machine, An updated CRUD Python driver will be created, as well as a new User Interface. The project also consists of a README file so that users or stakeholders are able to install or recreate the projecct on the Windows system.</p>
